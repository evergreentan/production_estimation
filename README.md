# Production Function Estimation

This repository serves to 
- summarize cannonical related lecture notes and literature (esp. existing estimation strategies, estimation issuess, solutions to those problems, and etc.)
- (hopefully) replicate some empirical work using python (I have no idea what and how to replicate so far...).
